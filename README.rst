tivoskill
=========

An Alexa skill (using `lambdaskill <https://github.com/michaeluhl/lambdaskill>`__) 
for interfacing with a TiVo.  This skill requires
a device on the same network as the TiVo to be running the
`tivoproxy <https://github.com/michaeluhl/tivoproxy>`__ server.
Further, communication between the skill and the proxy server is
accomplished via `PubNub <https://www.pubnub.com>`__, and thus
a PubNub account is required.
